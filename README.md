### About Me



```
I am a sophomore at BSU pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science. Unlike most I found programming and CS through a math perspective, I have always been interested in learning to code but didn't get around to it until college. I like to challenge myself and CS has been fun but also really challenging and sometimes irritating but I am slowly becoming more familliar and comfortable. Some things I do outside of school and programming include hiking, exploring and skateborading. Check out https://tactics.com and you can find some of my videos and some great gear too!

### Experience

I am very familliar with Java and staring to learn C, I have taken CS 121, 220 and am currently enrolled in 253.
