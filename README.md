### About Me

```
I am a sophomore at BSU pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science. Unlike most I found
programming and CS through a math perspective, I have always been interested in learning to 
code but didn't get around to it until college. I like to challenge myself and CS has been 
fun but also really challenging and sometimes irritating but I am slowly becoming more 
familliar and comfortable. Some things I do outside of school and programming include hiking,
exploring and skateborading. Check out https://tactics.com/ and you can find some of my 
videos and some great gear too!
